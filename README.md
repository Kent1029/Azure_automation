# AZURE AUTOMATION


This repository contains a collection of Azure Automation runbooks and scripts that can be used to automate common tasks in Azure.

## Now we have the following automations:

### [Storage Account](Storage_account)
**Automator to download files from Azure Blob Storage and send an email notification to the user before they expired the access right.**

### [FireWall Blocklist](FireWall_Blocklist)
**In the this part, you can add and modify the FQDN Block list from Trend Micro in the Firewall Policy Rule through the Azure API.**
